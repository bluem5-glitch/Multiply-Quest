This is the official repository for Multiply Quest, the mobile application that won 1st Place in the South Carolina FBLA State Leadership Conference for Mobile Application Development.


## ðŸ“– About The Project

This mobile application was developed as a solo project to compete in the FBLA state competition. The goal was to build a fully functional and high-quality mobile application that met all of the competition's rigorous standards. I chose this category specifically because it presented a significant technical challenge that I was eager to take on.

As a solo developer on this project, I faced several challenges that provided valuable learning experiences:

 Challenge: Implementing the scoring logic was tricky because I had to manage multiple variables in real-time.
 Solution: I solved this by creating a dedicated function to update the score, which made the code cleaner and easier to debug.
 Lesson Learned: This project taught me the importance of  planning project structure before writing code, debugging systematically, etc.. It solidified my skills in JavaScript and user interface design.
